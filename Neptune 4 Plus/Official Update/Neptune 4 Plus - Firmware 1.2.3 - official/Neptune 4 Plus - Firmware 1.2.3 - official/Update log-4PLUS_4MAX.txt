Notes: 
1.If your current firmware version of NEPTUNE 4 PLUS/MAX is earlier than 1.2.2.64, it is recommended to update the fix pack first to avoid errors due to compatibility issues.
2.Using the fix pack(1.2.2.65) will automatically delete the contents in the task list:
If you are used to uploading print files on the web side for printing, please note: To ensure that the system has enough memory to update the fix pack, this update will automatically delete the contents of the task list in the local memory. If necessary, please back up in advance.

1.2.2.65Firmware fix pack mainly solves the problem:
1.Resolve compatibility issues encountered when upgrading firmware across versions.
2.Can fix the compatibility issues that will occur after updating klipper/moonraker/fluidd (Note: this product does not support updating the official klipper, otherwise there will be compatibility errors).
The test situation is as follows:
 a. Simulation test: Use kiauh to uninstall klipper/moonraker/fluidd and directly use the firmware fix pack. The machine starts normally but cannot access the web side and needs to reinstall fluidd using kiauh.
 b. Simulation test: Use kiauh to uninstall moonraker and fluidd.  Then install only the official moonraker, not fluidd.  After the device is powered on, it is always stuck in the startup screen.  Shut down, and the machine starts normally after using the firmware fix pack.  After updating the new firmware, no abnormal error was found.  (web cannot be accessed.)
 c.Simulation test: After mistakenly deleting klipper/moonraker/fluidd in the management folder, the firmware fix package is used directly, and the machine starts normally.
 d.Simulation test: klipper/moonraker/fluidd was upgraded in the background, and then the firmware repair package was directly used. The machine started normally and could access the web.
